# Argon One Service and Control scripts for CentOS

[Argon ONE](https://www.argon40.com/raspberry-pi-cases/argon.html) is a case for the Raspberry Pi which includes a controllable fan. It comes with [software](https://download.argon40.com/argon1.sh) to control this fan unfortunately this is not adapted for CentOS and variants. I have adapted this script to work for CentOS.

Tested on CentOS 7 Kernel 5.4.56-v7l.1.el7 on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.
